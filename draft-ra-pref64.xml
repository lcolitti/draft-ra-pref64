    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a Router Advertisement option to configure the NAT64 prefix.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>NAT64 <xref target="RFC6146"/> with DNS64 <xref target="RFC6147"/> is a widely-deployed mechanism to provide IPv4 access on IPv6-only networks. In order to support functions such as local validation of DNSSEC <xref target="RFC4033"/> responses, 464xlat <xref target="RFC6877"/>, and local IPv4 address synthesis <xref target="RFC8305"/>, the host must be aware of the NAT64 prefix in use by the network. This document specifies a Router Advertisement <xref target="RFC4861"/> option to communicate the NAT64 prefix to hosts.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Why include the NAT64 prefix in Router Advertisements">
      <t>Fate sharing. NAT64 requires a routing to be configured. IPv6 routing configuration requires receiving an IPv6 Router Advertisement <xref target="RFC4861"/>. Compared to currently-deployed NAT64 prefix discovery methods such as <xref target="RFC7050"/>, including the NAT64 prefix in the Router Advertisement minimizes the number of packets required to configure a host. This speeds up the process of connecting to a network that supports NAT64/DNS64, and simplifies host implementation by removing the possibility that the a can have an incomplete layer 3 configuration (e.g., IPv6 addresses and prefixes, but no NAT64 prefix).</t>

      <t>Deployability. All IPv6 hosts and networks are required to support <xref target="RFC4861"/>. Other options such as <xref target="RFC7225"/>b require implementing other protocols.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Semantics">
      <t>This option specifies exactly one NAT64 prefix for all IPv4 addresses. Observation of current deployments suggest that they use RFC7050, which also only supports one prefix.</t>

      <t>The lifetime of this option is tied to the Router Lifetime.</t>

               (including the Type and Length fields) is in units of 8 octets. The only valid value for this filed is 2. A host MUST ignore the NAT64 prefix option if the length field value is not set to 2.</c>

               (relative to the time the packet is received) over which
	       this NAT64 prefix MAY be used is equal to the Router Lifetime value. A value of zero indicates that
	       this NAT64 prefix MUST no longer be used.</c>
       <c>Prefix Length</c> <c> 8-bit unsigned integer.  The number of leading bits in the Prefix that are valid. The value of this field MUST be between 32 and 96 (<xref target="RFC6052"/>). A host MUST ignore the PREF64 Option with the Prefix Length value higher than 96 or lower than 32.</c>
       <c> Reserved</c> <c>This field is unused.  It MUST be initialized to
                     zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Because Router Advertisements are required in all IPv6 configuration scenarios, on IPv6-only networks, Router Advertisements must already be secured, e.g., by deploying RA guard <xref target="RFC6105"/>. Providing all configuration in Router Advertisements increases security by ensuring that no other protocols can be abused by malicious attackers to provide hosts with invalid configuration.</t>
      <t>The security measures that must already be in place to ensure that Router Advertisements are only received from legitimate sources eliminate the problem of PREF64 validation described in section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC7050"/>.</t>
